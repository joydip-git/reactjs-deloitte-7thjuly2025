passing data between components

	a. immediately nested components -> props
	b. deeply nested components -> context object
	c. the components are not in the same tree and you are NOT using "lift the state up" -> application-wide state management (components will manage the state)
		i. ONLY one source of data
		ii. components which nedd that date will subscribe to the source of data
		iii. when the source of data is updated, every subscribed component will be notified
		iv. preditable way of maintaining and updating a common state
		v. data flows from that storage to the subscribed components
		vi. the updation should be synchronous
